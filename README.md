# Assorted-Scripts
Sometimes I write little scripts with no real reason behind doing so. I'll put those here. They'll probably all be in Python.

binarySearch.py -- I wrote this in response to running across this old article: https://reprog.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/are-you-one-of-the-10-percent/

The claim was that only 10% of professional programmers -- those at Bell Labs and IBM, which dates the original source (1986) -- were able to correctly implement a binary search, given a few hours and the criteria that they NOT use any research or testing. (I might be imagining the research requirement -- I didn't look up anything at all, except some basketball scores -- but I'm assuming there was no StackOverflow in 1986.) 90% found at least some bugs in their code.

binarySearch.py is my first attempt at implementing a binary search (in Python). Everything after the initial comment and before the main() method (technically everything before the import statement) is exactly as I originally wrote it (including inaccurate comments, lol); the main() method itself used to be much simpler, but I expanded it after the initial tests in order to test more thoroughly and efficiently. My implementation works! I'm a little embarrassed by how relieved I am, but it's nice to be in the top 10% of IBM/Bell Labs programmers.
